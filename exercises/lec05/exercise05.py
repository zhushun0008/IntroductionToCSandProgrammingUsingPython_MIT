    Write an iterative function iterPower(base, exp) that calculates the 
    exponential base^exp by simply using successive multiplication. 
    For example, iterPower(base, exp) should compute base^exp by multiplying base 
    times itself exp times. Write such a function below.
    (Use of the ** operator is not allowed)
    Inputs:
        base - can be a float or an integer
        exp - will be an integer â‰¥ 0

        Return one numerical value. Your code must be iterative

    base: int or float.

    Another way to solve this problem just using multiplication (and remainder) 
    is to note that 
        base^exp=(base^2)^(exp/2)        if exp > 0 and exp is even
        base^exp = base * base^(exp-1)   if exp > 0 and exp is odd
        base^exp = 1                     if exp = 0
    Write a procedure recurPowerNew which recursively computes exponentials 
    using this idea.

    elif exp % 2 == 0:
        return recurPowerNew(base*base, exp/2)

    # Otherwise, exp must be > 0 and odd, so use the second
    #  recursive case.

def gcdIter(a, b):
    '''
    The greatest common divisor of two positive integers is the largest integer that divides each of them without remainder. For example,
        gcd(2, 12) = 2
        gcd(6, 12) = 6
        gcd(9, 12) = 3
        gcd(17, 12) = 1

    Write an iterative function, gcdIter(a, b), that implements this idea.
    One easy way to do this is to begin with a test value equal to the smaller 
    of the two input arguments, and iteratively reduce this test value by 1 
    until you either reach a case where the test divides both a and b without 
    remainder, or you reach 1.
    inputs: 
        a, b - positive integers

    Hint1
        String slicing may be useful in this problem...
    Hint2
        How would you check if a string is empty without using len()? 
        An easy way you can check if a string, s, is empty is to check the 
        condition
            s == '' 
    '''
    s = aStr

def isIn(char, aStr):
    '''
    We can use the idea of bisection search to determine if a character is in 
    a string, so long as the string is sorted in alphabetical order.

    First, test the middle character of a string against the character you're 
    looking for (the "test character"). If they are the same, we are done - 
    we've found the character we're looking for!
    If they're not the same, check if the test character is "smaller" than 
    the middle character. If so, we need only consider the lower half of the 
    string; otherwise, we only consider the upper half of the string. 
    (Note that you can compare characters using Python's < function.)

    Implement the function isIn(char, aStr) which implements the above idea 
    recursively to test if char is in aStr. char will be a single character 
    and aStr will be a string that is in alphabetical order. The function 
    should return a boolean value.

    As you design the function, think very carefully about what the base cases 
    should be.
    Inouts:
        char - a single character
        aStr - an alphabetized string
